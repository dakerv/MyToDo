# A To-Do app with a focus on maximalist themes! 👋
Noticing a new trend of apps having coloured themes, from the standard light mode and dark mode, to detailed, customized themes, like the snapchat+ system.
I have decided to do one of my own, using one of the easiest apps to create ever, a to-do app!

For my first iteration, I have dark modes of the colours pink, green and neutral.
With decorative pieces and a gradient as a background, this feels like something you would pay for on other apps! 🫡

In future iterations, I plan to add lighter modes of these themes, basically a gradient with much lighter tones.
